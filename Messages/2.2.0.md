*SublimeHaskell* 2.2.0
======================

SublimeHaskell now uses new major `hsdev` release: `hsdev-0.3.3.1`.
New version can be installed with stack using `lts-13.29`, however it has some additional dependencies. You can either install it from sources or using custom `stack.yaml` file.

From sources:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mvoidex/hsdev -b 0.3.3.1
$ cd hsdev
$ stack install
```

Using this config (lets name it `hsdev-0.3.3.1.yaml`):
```
packages: []
resolver: lts-13.29
extra-deps:
- hsdev-0.3.3.1
- haddock-api-2.21.0
- hdocs-0.5.3.1
- network-3.0.1.1
```

Ask stack to install: `stack install hsdev --stack-yaml hsdev-0.3.3.1.yaml`

`cabal install hsdev-0.3.3.1` should also work at least for `ghc-8.2.2`, `ghc-8.4.3`, `ghc-8.6.1`.

Improvements
===

Major improvements are:
1. Now uses `haskell-names` package to resolve names. `Go to definition` now should work for local defs too. There also popup on hover which allows you to select all usages of symbol in current file.
2. Stores data using `sqlite` which is fast and uses much less memory

New commands
===
There're also some new commands:

 - `Eval expression` — evaluate expression in context of current module, outputs evaluated result in panel
 - `Expression type` — evaluate expression type in context of current module, outputs type in panel
 - `Show symbol usages` (context menu) — shows all usages of symbol (click on location to open file)
