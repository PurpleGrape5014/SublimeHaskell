*SublimeHaskell* 2.2.0
======================

SublimeHaskell now uses new major `hsdev` release: `hsdev-0.3.2.0`.
New version can be installed with stack using `lts-12.12`:
```
git clone https://github.com/mvoidex/hsdev -b 0.3.2.0
cd hsdev
stack install
```
Or you can specify another resolver with `stack install --resolver lts-12.5`

`cabal install hsdev-0.3.2.0` should also work at least for `ghc-8.0.2`, `ghc-8.2.2`, `ghc-8.4.3`.

Improvements
===

Major improvements are:
1. Now uses `haskell-names` package to resolve names. `Go to definition` now should work for local defs too. There also popup on hover which allows you to select all usages of symbol in current file.
2. Stores data using `sqlite` which is fast and uses much less memory

New commands
===
There're also some new commands:

 - `Eval expression` — evaluate expression in context of current module, outputs evaluated result in panel
 - `Expression type` — evaluate expression type in context of current module, outputs type in panel
 - `Show symbol usages` (context menu) — shows all usages of symbol (click on location to open file)
